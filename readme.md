# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling Project

## Dataset

This project comprises of three datasets 
- `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` downloaded manually and  contains basic tweet data of about 2356 [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) tweets downloaded by [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs) from their twitter archive

- `image_predictions.tsv` downloaded programmatically from Udacity servers and contains a table full of image predictions (the top three only) which comprises of about 2075 tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).

- The third dataset which comprises of about 2327 observations was obtained using Tweepy to query Twitter's API. 

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, it was also observed that the highest rated dog stage by tweet is Puppo. Consequently, it was discovered that based on the  algorithm's #1 prediction, the most popular dog breed is the golden retriever. I also found that there is a high positive correlation between retweet count and favorite count, with the favorite counts being significantly higher than retweet count.   


## Key Insights of Project
For the project, I focus mainly on effectively gathering, assessing, and cleaning the data, then create informative visualizations and gain meaningful insights.
